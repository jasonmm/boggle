I haven't really coded in C for the last decade. Just Java, Perl, and
Python with excursions into other high-level functional languages. 

Recently, I had the urge to get back to my roots and relearn C. 

For my first little toy project, I'm writing a program that, given a
Boggle board, will solve it, finding all the english words that
appear. 

I've implemented this before in Python about a year ago (I included
that solution too for comparison). 

The C version is clearly still in progress and it's slow going since
I'm re-familiarizing myself with the idioms of developing in that
language. I'm also taking a fundamentally different approach this
time, since I've had a year of background thinking on the most
efficient way to do this.
